Dear friends,

Welcome to the HGP GH pages. Maja, Mislav and me have finally finished a
project with a fixed deadline, so I am back to glycoscience visibility
discussion some of us have had at [*the 2nd Meeting of the Human Glycome
Project*][HGP2019] some 10 day ago. <!--more-->

For more details of the results I have presented please check the 
[Glycoscience visibility][hgp2019talk] post.

Since we do not have a solution to the problems presented, best thing is to
continue discussion as a community, and pursue strategies we all agree on.

This pages on GH have all the tools we need for our purpose.
We have [GH Pages][home] for static web site, [GH issue tracking
system][issues] ideal for discussing different concepts/issues related to
particular problem, [GH repositories][org] for problem compartmentalization of
data/code/issues, etc.
